<ul>
<li><strong>Fishing Rod:</strong> A fishing rod is used to cast your line and catch fish. Beginners might start with a basic rod and reel combo.</li>
<li><strong>Fishing Reel:</strong> The reel attaches to the rod and is used to wind in the line. Choose a reel that matches the type of fishing you plan to do.</li>
<li><strong>Fishing Line:</strong> The line connects your bait to the reel. Different types and strengths of lines are available depending on the type of fishing.</li>
<li><strong>Hooks:</strong> Hooks are used to catch fish by attaching bait or lures. They come in various sizes and shapes.</li>
<li><strong>Bait/Lures:</strong> Bait can be live (e.g., worms) or artificial (e.g., lures) and is used to attract fish. Choose bait based on the type of fish you’re targeting.</li>

          </a>Basic Fishing Techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Casting:</strong> Learn how to cast your line into the water effectively. Practice different casting techniques to improve your accuracy and distance.</li>
<li><strong>Reeling In:</strong> Once a fish bites, use the reel to pull it in. Be patient and maintain tension on the line to avoid losing the fish.</li>
<li><strong>Setting the Hook:</strong> When you feel a bite, quickly pull the rod to set the hook in the fish’s mouth. This increases the chances of successfully catching the fish.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Fish:</strong> Gently handle fish to avoid harming them. Use a landing net to help bring the fish in and avoid touching their gills or eyes.</li>
</ul>
