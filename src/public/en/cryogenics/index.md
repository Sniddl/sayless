title: Cryogenics
---

Cryogenics is the study of materials and their behavior at extremely low temperatures, typically below -150°C (-238°F). It involves the production and application of cold temperatures for various scientific and industrial purposes, such as preserving biological samples, improving the performance of superconductors, and enabling space exploration technologies.
