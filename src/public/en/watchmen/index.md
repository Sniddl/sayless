title: Watchmen
---

"Watchmen" is a graphic novel set in an alternate reality where superheroes exist, but they are flawed and complex. The story explores themes of power, morality, and the consequences of vigilantism. A key plot point involves a fake alien invasion using a giant squid, representing manipulation and fear to achieve peace.

The appearance of tentacles in modern media often symbolizes the unknown, fear, or something alien. This imagery, influenced by works like "Watchmen" and H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos, taps into primal fears and the idea of cosmic horror—forces beyond human understanding.
